Sending a Message to OIOI
=========================

To send a message, your server issues a POST request to::

    https://api.plugsurfing.com/api/v3/request

.. note:: The staging server for testing is located at https://dev-api.plugsurfing.com/api/v3/request

A message request is made of 2 parts: HTTP header and HTTP body.
The HTTP header must contain the following headers::

    Authorization: key=<your-API-key>
    Content-Type: application/json

The HTTP body must contain the JSON request.
Example HTTP request::

    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: key=a39ff3fb-fe0a-40a3-bdde-df6372c07c89

    {
        "station-get-by-center-radius": {
            "center-lat": 52.5167,
            "center-long": 13.3833,
            "radius": 100,
            "unit": "km"
        }
    }

.. important:: OIOI is not a REST interface. Instead, it is simple JSON over HTTP.
               All requests are sent to the same endpoint.
               The receiver will know which resource to use based on the request body.

Response
--------

If the request was valid and successful,
the response will contain the requested data or information about the success.
Otherwise, the HTTP response code will not be 200 and more information about the error will be inside the response body.

Possible response codes and their meanings:
