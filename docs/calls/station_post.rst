Station Post
============

.. warning:: It is not allowed to change the connectors of an existing station.

.. warning:: The station's connectors' IDs may not be changed once it is created.

You have to send one request for each station.
It is not possible to send multiple stations with one request.

.. note:: To ensure very high data quality, PlugSurfing manually curates all charging station and connector data.
          This means that data on the PlugSurfing platform may not correspond 100% to the data you push.

          Furthermore, PlugSurfing groups stations to simplify access from clients like the PlugSurfing app.
          As a result, multiple stations you push may show as a single station on the PlugSurfing platform,
          with all connectors from all individual stations associated to the grouped station.

Request
-------

``"station-post"`` identifies the call as a station-post call.
