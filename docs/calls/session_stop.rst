Session Stop
============

Request
-------

``"session-stop"`` identifies the call as a session-stop call.

Fields
~~~~~~

user
    This field identifies the customer (object).

    identifier-type
        How to identify the user (string).

        The identifier-type can be one of:

        * ``"evco-id"``
        * ``"rfid"``
        * ``"username"``

        .. note:: For session-start and session-stop it is common to use ``"evco-id"`` as the identifier-type.

    identifier
        The identifier is something that uniquely identifies the customer,
        depending on the identifier-type (string).
    token (optional)
        A token can be used to authenticate the user (string).

        For example: if the identifier type is username and the identifier is the user's username,
        then token is used for authentication instead of a password.
connector-id
   The EVSE ID that identifies the connector where the session should be stopped (string).
session-id (optional)
   A unique ID that identifies this session (string). 

   .. warning:: Depending on the CPO's requirements, a ``session-id`` may be mandatory.
