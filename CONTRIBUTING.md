# Code Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to the documentation are very welcome.
If you do not have write access to the repository,
please create a pull request with a single commit.

## Branches
Branch `master` represents the latest version: v4

Branch `stable` represents the stable version: v3

If you make general changes,
e.g. in the introduction,
branch off stable,
make the changes in the new branch,
and then merge the new branch into `stable` and `master`.

Do *not* merge `master` into `stable` or the other way around.
